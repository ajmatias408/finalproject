# Background

Alliance of Genome Resources is to create and maintain reliable genome information resources that support the study of various types of model organisms. By understnadin gthe genetic and genomic aspects of such organisms, scientists and rsearchs are able to gain information about the health and diseases correlated to human biology. The goal is this search bar is to be able to discover advance genome biological research and use that for translation of human genome data into clinical applications.

The modular information system architecture serves diverse user communities, including human geneticiists seeking access to data on orthologous human genes, basic scienece researchers using specific model organisms to explore fundamental biology, computational biologists and data scientists in the need of an all-in-all data.

# Usage

The usage of this program is very straight forward. Simply click this link http://bfx3.aap.jhu.edu/amatias1/final/alliance.html and search for a disease. This way, you are able to see what correlation different diseases have. Note that there are approximately 1.4M different types of disease variations, but I made it simple so that you can briefly see what (eg. Parkinson's Disease) is correlated with.
